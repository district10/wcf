As is shown is this set of drawings, these flowers grow greatly in protection of the green house, but died out quickly under rain and lighting.

That's exactly what our life looks like, we young people look strong as to fear nothing, but can't survive terrible conditions alone. As the new generation, we receive intensive care and protection from our family, school and the society. We gain fair amount of knowledge, cultivate good manners and act like we are capable of living independently. However, we are so far away from that, that a small challenge may make us fall and fail. In other words, we are spoilt.

Real life makes real man. Man can't gain strength in a cozy life and we must devote ourselves in challenges, drawbacks and hardships, then we grow. Take the pain to achieve the gains.

First, government should build a system of policy to regulate this kind of misfortune. Actually, there are already some and one of them is really effective though controversal which says it is illeagle not to go back home visiting the old ones in a constant 2 years. Moreover, school education should pay more attention towards this issue to guide people even the whole society to love, respect and take care of the old. Still, volunteers should be called up to help. For example, young puiples may volunteer to talk and play with the old ones which not only helps to releave lonliness of the later but still is educational to the former. Last but not the least, welfare, key to this problem, should be set up.

As is discussed above, the old people need our help and we shall take our undeniable responsibility. After all, everyone will be old and doesn't want to be left alone and helpless by the society.

    recommend one of your favorite movies and
    give reasons for your recommendation

正文

Dear Maomao,

Yesterday, I reviewed again Big Fish, one of my beloved best movies. It tells a fantasy story about a father, a hard one to undertand. The father's story seems irrealistic and not logical at once but turns out genuine in the end.

It's a touching love story about Edward Bloon (the father) and Sandraw Templeton, a faithful dreamful one which is not common nowadays. It's an advanture with lots of fantacy everyone would enjoy. It's a porcess to undertsand how a father is and his lifestyle.

Anyway, Big Fish is one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend you it. I can't tell you more without being a spoiler thought I really want to. Enjoy!

正文：

As is shown on the drawing, undergraduates have four main roads to choose from on the journey of life. Some of them are inclined to find a job and work, while some others choose to work for themselves or even creating jobs and hiring others. Besides them, a large percent of them takes the exam to graduate schools or even go abroad to further their study.

Most undergraduates are confused at these choices and wonder what's right thing to do. Under preasure pressure of living independently and potential marriages, they feel at lost and not a small number of them choose to follow the others. The situation should be changed. First, college should guide undergraduates to be preparedd to live in society and plunge into workforce. Moreover, they themselves should look inside to their heart asking what they themselves care capable of and suitable to do. Only through this way can rational choices be made. Last but not the least, government should make proper adequate polices to offer better more opportunities. Hope every undergraduate follow their heart, choose the right way and have a bright future.

On the left of the drawing, the mother takes hand of the little girl, which reveals the situation 30 years ago, while now the girl grown to be a lady grabs hand of the old woman, the above-mentioned mother.

This drawing reflects love and devotion between parents and children. When we are young, our parents provided us with sheltering, food and love, so we can grow up and live independently. Then they are old, we in return take care of and make our devotion to them just like they did years before. This cycle reveals the meaning of families. Love and devotion in families have meanings you may not know. First, they are symbols of family harmoney and contribute to the general harmoney (harmony) and contribute to the general harmoney of the society and our country. Moreover, they are key factors to the survival of human being.

Last but not least, with guarantee of protection from next generation, we can settle down and devote ourselves to contributions to the society making our nation prosperate.

Above all, that's the meaning of families --- love and devotion.

As is described on the drawing, there are two definitely different points of views on the same bottle of spilt milk. The passive man on the left thinks it all over while the man on the right positively looks at the bright side saying that there are still half bottle of milk left.

This reflects two distinct attitudes towards life: being optimistic or being pessimistic. On one hand, a optimisticc man focuses on the positive side of things who tends to live a happier life with joy, while passmistic people feel awkward with multitudes of things. However, in the same time, the former are inclined to get used to everything such that they are not fully commited to change, while the later scratches their own itchy a lot and comes up with new ideas and improvements to things one after another. That's to say, we shall combine the former and the later that we can live happily with a good temper cultivated with an optimistic view to life and think critically witha passimistic attitude towards work to make progress.
Through the discussion above, we will not act like any one of them as described in the drawing. Instead, we shall be grateful to the little drops left for us and without forgetting to try to figure out a way to avoid such tragedy in the future.
